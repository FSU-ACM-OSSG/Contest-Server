				<h3>So how does this contest thing work?</h1>
				<p>It starts with a question.<br /><br />

				You'll get a prompt, which has both some
				flavor text, as well as a description of the problem. You'll also be
				given some constraints on the input, as well as some sample input and
				corresponding output.<br /><br />

				From there, your team will need to work together
				to write code that will produce the correct output for any input we
				could throw at you.<br /><br />

				Scoring is done by combining how quickly your team submitted the solution
				with how fast your solution ran. The teams with the best score win.

				<h3>How much experience do I need?</h1>
					<p>

						No Google, no StackOverflow.
