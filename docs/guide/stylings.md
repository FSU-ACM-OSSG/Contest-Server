# Styling the Webapp

This project uses Sass to define the styles. Sass needs to be pre-compiled into CSS before the image is built. In Development mode, when Sass rebuilds the changes are automatically updated in the app. However, if you are making changes outside of development mode, run `gulp` to rebuild the Sass styles.

For setting up Gulp and Sass:
``` bash
# Install project deps
> npm install

# Globally install gulp
> npm install -g gulp
```

::: warning
Be sure to install `npm` beforehand.
